# Flipqed
Flipqed is a game written in C# and is a file "hide and seek" game.

Flipqed is a game I made for fun where the game makes a .txt file. You have 5 minutes to find this .txt file.

The .txt file the game makes can be found in any of these folders/locations:

Downloads
Documents
Photos
Videos
Favorites
Saved Games

I will add more in the future and add cool stuff like more hiding directories and less/more time and custom settings.

Flipqed uses savefiles. The savefile is located in the exavt same directory as the game.

Why did you make the game?

- I was bored... again.
- Also I want my games like Flipqed and WHITE NOISE to be able to be played anywhere such as schools, on the go and basically anywhere you can open a .py or .exe.

Are there going to be updates?

- When I have time for it, yes.

Can I run this anywhere?

- Yes. All you need is: anything that can run .exe


As usual, I hope you enjoy this game as much as I enjoyed making it. If you like it, please leave a star, I appreciate it. Any suggestions or issues, post in the Issues tab. Thanks!
